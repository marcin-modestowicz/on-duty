# The On Duty App
This app uses Google's Firebase, so in order to run it, you would need to create an account, add a project in the console, install Firebase package locally. Short but excellent tutorial can be found on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/yurio/all-you-need-is-react-firebase-4v7g9p4kf). When you're done, put .firebaserc file in main directory and firebase.js config file in `src`.

After that, run `yarn` to install dependencies and use:
* `yarn start` to start dev server,
* `yarn build` to build production version,
* `yarn flow` to do a types check,
* `yarn test` to run unit and snapshot tests,
* `yarn storybook` to view living documentation.
